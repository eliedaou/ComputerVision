These files were created by Elie Daou for Dr. Megherbi's Computer Vision class at the Universtiy of Massachusetts Lowell.

This code reads an input image (256x256 mri image, not the 256x342 Porsche image) and:
	Part 1: Outputs a 256x256 image file that is modified from the original image. The left half is left untouched
		and the right half is just black 
	Part 2: Outputs a 128x128 image file that is the original image scaled down. AKA only copying the even pixels
		in the vertical and horizontal directions.

This directory should contain the following files:
EdaouLab1Report.pdf
makefile
mri
Prog1_Edaou.c
README_edaou

To compile the program type:
$ make

run the code by typing:
$ ./Prog1_sample mri mri_outP1 mri_outP2 

To view the original mri image type:
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat mri) | xv -

To view the output mri image for part 1 (black-out right half of the image):
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat mri_outP1) | xv -

To view the output mri image for part 2 (Only transfer each even pixel, both horizontally and vertically):
$ (echo P5; echo 128 128; echo 255; cat mri_outP1) | xv -

To clean the object file and created mri output files type:
make clean
