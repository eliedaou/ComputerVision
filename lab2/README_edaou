These files were created by Elie Daou for Dr. Megherbi's Computer Vision class at the Universtiy of Massachusetts Lowell.

This code reads an input image (256x256 mri image, not the 256x342 Porsche image) and:
	Part 1: Outputs two 256x256 image files. The first is the centered spectrum of the inputted (256x256) file. 
                The second is the original 256x256 inputted file, after it has been fourier-ed and inveresed.
	Part 2: Outputs two 256x256 image files, as well. The first is the centered butterworth filter in a (256x256) file. 
                The second is the original 256x256 inputted file, after it has been had the butterworth LPF applied.

This directory should contain the following files:
EdaouLab2Report.pdf
makefile
mri
Prog2_edaou.c
README_edaou
various .png screenshots of the results (these are also in the report)

To compile the program type:
$ make

To clean the object file and created mri output files type:
$ make clean

run the code by typing:
$ ./Prog2_edaou mri 

To view the original mri image type:
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat mri) | xv -

To view the output spectrum image for part 1:
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat Centered_Spectrum) | xv -

To view the original mri image after itâ€™s been processed for part 1:
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat Inverted_Original_Image) | xv -

To view the output butterworth filter for part 2 :
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat Butterworth_Filter) | xv -

To view the output butterworth filter for part 2 :
$ (echo P5; echo 256 256; echo 255; cat Buttered_Filtered_Image) | xv -
